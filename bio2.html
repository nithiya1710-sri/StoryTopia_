                        Harriet Tubman, born Araminta Ross around 1822 on a Maryland plantation, grew up in the brutal reality of slavery. From a young age, she endured harsh labor and severe punishments, but even as a child, she was known for her strong will and determination. Harriet's deep sense of injustice was solidified when, at the age of 12, she was struck on the head by a heavy metal weight, causing lifelong seizures and visions.
 These visions, which she believed were messages from God, would guide her throughout her life.

In 1849, at around 27 years old, Harriet made the brave decision to escape to freedom. Despite the danger, with 
slave catchers and patrols at every turn

                  “Princess Bubblegum”, although often portrayed as kind and diplomatic, has her own complicated story. As the ruler of the Candy Kingdom, she is a brilliant scientist, but her pragmatic and sometimes morally questionable decisions reflect her desire to maintain order and protect her people. Finn initially has a crush on her, but as he matures, his feelings evolve, especially after meeting Flame Princess, another love interest with a fiery personality.
                 
                  Marceline the Vampire Queen, a thousand-year-old vampire with a rockstar persona, is one of Finn and Jake’s closest friends. She has a deep emotional history, especially with the Ice King, who, before losing his sanity, was like a father figure to her. Marceline’s past is slowly revealed throughout the series, showing her as a deeply complex character struggling with abandonment, her immortal life, and her relationships.

                        Over the course of about a decade, Tubman made around 13 missions back to the South, guiding 70 enslaved individuals to freedom, including members of her own family. She became known as "Moses" for leading people to freedom, and she never lost a single passenger on her dangerous journeys.

                  The series is filled with humor, quirky side characters, and surreal moments, but it also delves into deep and emotional storytelling. Themes of friendship, sacrifice, and existential reflection are woven into the narrative. Finn’s journey is marked by a gradual coming-of-age story, where he learns to deal with the complexities of life, not just through heroism, but through empathy and understanding.

                  In the later seasons, the series explores more philosophical themes, including the nature of existence, life, and death. One of the central figures in these discussions is “BMO”, a sentient gaming console and robot who often contemplates life and what it means to have a purpose.

                    ver the next decade, Harriet Tubman became a legendary figure in the Underground Railroad, a secret network of safe houses and 
abolitionists dedicated to helping enslaved people reach freedom. Using her knowledge of the landscape and her faith, Harriet led approximately 13 missions back into slave territory, rescuing more than 70 enslaved men, women, and children, including several of her family members. She never lost a single person on her missions, earning the nickname "Moses" for leading her people to freedom.

Tubman’s success was due not only to her courage but also her careful planning. She always carried a revolver, both for protection and 
to motivate anyone who considered turning back.
